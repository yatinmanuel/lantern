# PXE Files

This directory is mounted into containers at `/var/www/html` and is used for
both HTTP (backend) and TFTP (dnsmasq) file serving.

Expected layout:
- `ipxe/` - iPXE boot files (e.g. `undionly.kpxe`, `ipxe.efi`) and `menu.ipxe`
- `os-files/` - cached OS artifacts downloaded by the backend
- `iso/` - ISO images for traditional PXE workflows

Notes:
- `menu.ipxe` is generated by the API (`POST /api/config/ipxe/regenerate`).
- Place iPXE binaries in `ipxe/` so the TFTP server can serve them.
- `dnsmasq.conf` may be generated by the API (`POST /api/config/service/dnsmasq/regenerate`)
  and consumed by the dnsmasq container.
